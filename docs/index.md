# My Seat Booking Library Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for My Seat Booking Library! This library allows you to easily manage seat booking and reservations for various modes of transportation.

## Installation

To install the library, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install my-seat-booking-library
```

## Basic Usage
You can start using the library by importing and rendering the SeatMap component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { SeatMap } from 'my-seat-booking-library';

const initialSeatData = [
  { seatNumber: 'A1', availability: 'available' },
  { seatNumber: 'A2', availability: 'booked' },
  // ... more seat data
];

const BasicExample = () => {
  const [seatData, setSeatData] = useState(initialSeatData);

  const handleSeatClick = (seatNumber) => {
    // Update seat availability logic
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Basic Seat Booking Example</h1>
      <SeatMap seatData={seatData} onSeatClick={handleSeatClick} />
    </div>
  );
};
export default BasicExample;
```

## Advanced Usage
For more advanced scenarios, you can utilize the ReservationManager utility:

```jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { SeatMap, ReservationManager } from 'my-seat-booking-library';

const initialSeatData = [
  // ...
];

const AdvancedExample = () => {
  const [seatData, setSeatData] = useState(initialSeatData);
  const reservationManager = new ReservationManager(seatData);

  const handleSeatClick = (seatNumber) => {
    reservationManager.reserveSeat(seatNumber);
    setSeatData([...reservationManager.getSeats()]);
  };

  const handleConfirmReservation = () => {
    reservationManager.confirmReservation();
    setSeatData([...reservationManager.getSeats()]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Advanced Seat Booking Example</h1>
      <SeatMap seatData={seatData} onSeatClick={handleSeatClick} />
      <button onClick={handleConfirmReservation}>Confirm Reservation</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AdvancedExample;
```
